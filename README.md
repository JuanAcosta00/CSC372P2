# Project 2 for CSC 372
This repository is for a custom language that has similar structure to python. This repository comes with a transpiler that I made that will transform the code into Java code, which can then be combiled and ran normally.

To run transpiler as a parser, first run <mark>javac *.java</mark> in the project directory, then run <mark>java Translator</mark> with no arguments

To run transpiler on a file, first run <mark>javac *.java</mark> if you haven't already, then run <mark>java Translator fileName.txt</mark> with just the file name as an argument, this will make a new file with the same name in java. You can then run <mark>javac *.java</mark> to compile the newly created file, and run the new file using <mark>Java filename</mark>.
